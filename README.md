# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Project
Description:
This project involves the analysis of coffee sales data from three restaurants over a period of six months using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes detailed 
information on daily sales, such as the type of coffee sold, quantity, sales amount, month name and other relevant metrics.

The primary objective of this project is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into the coffee sales performance of each restaurant and identify trends,
patterns, and areas for improvement.

Key Components:

Data Collection and Preparation: The raw sales data for each restaurant over six months is downloaded from maven analytics and imported into Excel and organized into a structured format, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

Pivot Tables and Charts: Pivot tables are created to summarize and aggregate the sales data based on various dimensions such as date, coffee type, and restaurant location. Additionally, dynamic charts and graphs are generated to visualize trends in sales volume, revenue, popular coffee choices, and other key metrics.

Interactive Dashboard: An interactive dashboard is developed to present the analysis findings in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. The dashboard allows stakeholders to dynamically explore the data by adjusting filters(slicers), selecting specific time periods, and drilling down into detailed insights. It includes interactive elements such as slicers, dropdown menus, and buttons for enhanced interactivity.

Key Metrics and Insights: The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides insights into sales trends, seasonality effects, best-selling products, peak hours, and customer preferences. This information enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and devise strategies to optimize coffee sales and maximize revenue.

Overall, this Excel project empowers stakeholders with valuable insights into coffee sales performance across multiple restaurants, enabling informed decision-making and driving business growth in the competitive hospitality industry.
